# MQTT Publisher in Go

This is a simple Go program that connects to an MQTT broker, reads messages from the terminal, and publishes those messages to a specified MQTT topic. If the user presses ENTER without entering a message, a default message is sent.

## Features

- Connects to an MQTT broker specified in a `.env` file.
- Continuously reads messages from the terminal and publishes them to an MQTT topic.
- If no message is provided, sends a default message ("Hello continuous loop").

## Requirements

- Go (version 1.16 or later)
- Mosquitto (or any other MQTT broker)

## Setup

### 1. Install Go

If you donâ€™t have Go installed, download and install it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/

### 2. Install Mosquitto

You need an MQTT broker like Mosquitto to test this application.
